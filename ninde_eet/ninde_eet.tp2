  SAY BIO @4 /* "The past is precisely that -- the past." Ninde says, with a pointed yawn. Despite her initial reluctance, you soon manage to glean a little more information about the sun elf's past. Namely that although she was born in the Elven forest of Cormanthor, she was raised in Waterdeep, by a wealthy family of human traders, who spared no expense on her magical education. But although she developed a taste for the finer things in life, she was distinctly less delighted by the prospect of having to work for them To her adoptive families chagrin, she fell in with the city's seedier element, and began to delve into the shadier side of arcane lore. Soon she went from Waterdhavian high society's most desirable young ingenue to a regular among the ghosts and rats of its criminal underbelly. And indeed, whatever secrets she unearthed there have left their mark on the elf.
