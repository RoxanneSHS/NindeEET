@0    = ~Why.  Hello there, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  I certainly did not expect to see *you* so soon.  But here you are, swords drawn and spells-a-blazing.  It's all rather sweet.~
@1    = ~Hah!  Another bloodsucking fiend!  I shall take great pleasure in disposing of you, vampire.~
@2    = ~You're awfully condescending for someone about to be introduced to her own innards.~
@3    = ~What is a creature as lovely as you doing here, mm?  Certainly this is no place for a lady.~
@4    = ~You speak as though you know my mind--I do not like it.~
@5    = ~Do not be so hasty to reach for your weapons, <CHARNAME>.  And do not look so surprised that I know your name, either.  My mistress has been blathering inanely about you for nigh-on weeks.  It got rather tedious, I can tell you.~
@6    = ~But before I get carried away, allow me to introduce myself.  I am Lady Ninde Amblecrown; but you may call me Ninde.~
@7    = ~So you admit that Bodhi is your mistress, then?~
@8    = ~What is this?  Formal introductions in the middle of a battle?  You're wasting my time, elf.~
@9    = ~Blah, blah.  I grow bored.  I think it's time to see if your fighting is as good as your talking.~
@10   = ~Goodness.  I certainly did expect a slightly more aggressive reception from you, being a Bhaalspawn and such.  Heh, do not look so surprised that I know of your heritage--my mistress has been blathering inanely about you for nigh-on weeks.~
@11   = ~Your mind is one of the few things connected with you that I *don't* know, <CHARNAME>.  Ah, do not look so surprised that I recognise you--my mistress has been blathering inanely about you for nigh-on weeks.~
@12   = ~Well, I think it only fitting we get off on the right foot, start as we mean to continue and all that, if you are to be my leader from now on, <CHARNAME>.~
@13   = ~Oh?  Do go on...~
@14   = ~I think I see what you're getting at, my dear.~
@15   = ~Do not make me laugh, fiend!  Draw swords!~
@16   = ~Ah, then you are surely as dense as I assumed you would be.  Pity, but you can't blame a girl for trying.  I had hoped this wouldn't end in combat, but never mind.  You shall not take me as easily as you have these other beasts.~
@17   = ~Since my present mistress will be indisposed in the near future, I propose an advantageous union between the two of us.~
@18   = ~And what skills could you contribute to our group?~
@19   = ~No, I think not.  Now--quick.  Be on your way, elf, before I change my mind about killing you.~
@20   = ~I'm afraid I don't much trust you, elf.  I think the only sensible thing to do at this juncture would be to end your miserable little life, don't you agree?  Stand still, and I promise I'll make it fast.~
@21   = ~Well, that certainly is a shame.  We could have had a beautiful partnership you know, you and I.  If you happen to change your mind then you might find me in a charming little stink pit close to the city gates, absorbing the local ambience.  The Crooked Crane--I hope to see you there, my little strawberry.~
@22   = ~I suppose it was too much to hope that one with such a reputation as a brain-addled monkey would see reason.  And I suppose it is too much to hope that one with such a reputation as a warrior might be defeated by me.  Nonetheless, you'll not take me without a fight, Bhaalspawn.~
@23   = ~I am a Necromancer of no mean talent.  Mm...and of course, I would provide that extra touch of...class, which adventuring parties such as yours often lack.  So, what say you, Bhaalspawn?~
@24   = ~Yes.  You seem most capable--it will be a pleasure to have you join us.~
@25   = ~Well...all right then.  You better lose that treacherous streak though.~
@26   = ~Sorry...we don't really need a Necromancer on the party right now.  Plus...you're kind of spooking me out a little...~
@27   = ~Me?  Treacherous?  Never.  I am merely opportunistic.  Ensure that staying with you is the most profitable course for me, and I shall not turn my dagger on you.  Although your concern is most prudent--it would have been foolish of you not to doubt my reliability, all circumstances considered.  But, that aside.  Onward...to fortune and glory, or somesuch.~
@28   = ~And indeed, provided you keep the Cowls off my back, and some gold in my purse, I'm sure it shall be a pleasure to serve you, <CHARNAME>.~
@29   = ~Pfft, I suppose it is your choice, Bhaalspawn.  What with the impending slaughter, my sense of preservation demands I must head elsewhere.  Should you change your mind, you might find me in a rather charming little establishment at the City Gates, named the Crooked Crane.  You'll recognise it, I'm sure, sweetness.  Have some nice, violent fun.~
@30   = ~I admit to nothing of the sort.  I serve myself, and myself only.  The 'arrangement' I had with Bodhi was merely a convenience.  But I think that your presence here rather renders said arrangement void.  In fact, I have a proposition for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@31   = ~So this self-confessed traitor of an elf wishes to join us, I assume?  No doubt she thinks her beguiling manner will protect her from harm at the hands of those that would uphold goodness and virtue.  Bah, <CHARNAME>, I suppose I shall suffer her company if you will it.~
@32   = ~And so a strange fae glides from amidst the impermeable shadows with a mysterious glint in her eyes--aye, a dark creature she is, and as with all dark creatures, she no doubt has hidden claws.  Be on your guard, my raven.~
@33   = ~I don't trust this Ninde at all, <CHARNAME>.  If you choose to deal with her further, I suggest practising extreme caution.~
@34   = ~Ah, so this...this is Lady Amblecrown.  She is fairly well known amidst more, ah, unsavoury circles, <CHARNAME>.  The word was she likes to set herself up with whoever the big power is...But I assumed the Waterdhavian authorities caught up with her, as she has not been heard from in a few years.  I would certainly not be opposed to having her join us...That is, of course, if you are not.~
@35   = ~Oh?  Do go on, Ninde…~
@36   = ~And I have a proposition for YOU, elf--have at you!~
@37   = ~I think I can see where this is going.~
@38   = ~Oh, it's you again.  I see you're walking and talking, so congratulations, you've exceeded my expectations.  Have you come about our little...business proposal?~
@39   = ~Indeed I have.  We could use your skills, if you're still interested.~
@40   = ~Ha, nope.  I just came to watch a fine lady such as you marinating in this hole.  Amusing to say the least.~
@41   = ~No, we just happened to be nearby.  It's good to see you again, Ninde.~
@42   = ~Actually, I've decided to kill you.~
@43   = ~Ah, it's refreshing to know you've some remnant of common sense, Bhaalspawn.  One can go far on a little common sense in this city, it seems.  Very well, onward to glory and wealth, or something equally banal.~
@44   = ~I suppose simple things amuse the simple-minded.  Get your gawking done and leave, because your fat simian face is rather ruining the otherwise charmingly quaint scenery, peasant.~
@45   = ~How awfully sentimental.  I have little time for chitchat, Bhaalspawn.  Apologies for curtailing our little discourse, but more important matters call.~
@46   = ~I knew you were a dimwit the moment I set eyes on you, Bhaalspawn.  Truly, I pity you.  But I'm afraid you'll not have my blood today.  I wish Bodhi luck in gutting you, like she did your friend.  Imoen, is it?  Yes, I remember the little redhead screaming for mercy as her entrails were torn from her.  It did make for spectacular entertainment.  Farewell, my dear.  I'm sure we'll meet again.~
@47   = ~Och, Edwin, the spellchuckin' wench has a sharper tongue than you!  'Tis a good job she'll not be joining us, since I couldn't bear the both of ye, and she just happens to be a nicer shape.~
